# MECH578_GroupProject_1DGas
Group project for MECH 578 - Statistical thermodynamics.

Simulate a 1D gas - beads on a wire. Different masses - a,b. 
  This is then compared to:
    1. Integration of two Boltzmann equations - one for each gas. 
    2. The analytical solution given in Mohazzabi and Schmidt (Amer. J. Phys. 79, 861 (2011)).gas 

Three "modules" required:
    1. 1D gas simulation
    2. Integration of Boltzmann equation
    3. Comparison to the analytical solution
